i am Diagaro, from the 57th unit, and the Atlas is burning.

i have only been here for 13 months, and already this world has posses many wonders and horrors we did not expect. we thought that this world would be a desolate world barely livable for us, but it is anything but. we have seen countless flora and fauna. trees that roam the lands, animals that defy physics, and magic. me and my wife Claudia were mystified by this, and we felt lucky to have been given this chance by the Covenant. 2 months ago, we found a sapient species here. unit 34 found them first. at first, they just watched us, but after a week one came up to us. they look... almost human. they were tall and gangly, sharp eyes, and knifed ears. even their teeth were long and needle like. we called them elves as at first glance, they looked a little bit like the fantasy elves we had stories of. this particular elf had simple primitive cloths, but wield a dagger that seemed to be made of solid light, and at their hip was a worn but well cared for book. we called him Adam. it took us another month to decipher their language, but when we did, the floodgates were open.

I was the main scientist that took care of Adam. when he needed food, we would give it to him. as he gave us his knowledge, we gave him our knowledge. as soon we knew how his language worked, Claudia built us a translator, and i spoke to Adam.

"<span style="color:#4199e1">Hello Adam, i hope that you have found your stay her comfortable. are you able to understand me?</span>"
{.ahFont} 

"<span style="color:#FF4433">yes... i can  understand</span>"
{.asFont}

"<span style="color:#4199e1">That is good. we have been calling you Adam. is this name acceptable? </span>"
{.ahFont} 

"<span style="color:#FF4433">this name is fine. you need to know something.</span>"
{.asFont}

"<span style="color:#4199e1">ok, what do we need to know?</span>"
{.ahFont} 

"<span style="color:#FF4433">you and your kin are in great danger. there are those who are not pleased that you have intruded upon their land... time is of the essence</span>"
{.asFont}

"<span style="color:#4199e1">uh, ok. what do you mean? do you know who?</span>"
{.ahFont} 

that is when i heard the alarms. we didn't have any more time to talk, as in the next moment, something bursted through the wall.
